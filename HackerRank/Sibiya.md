Bias for Action (slight advantage in the YouTube video tutotal). Tutoring app feels like he should have know about LogCat and their deadline wasnt tight. For the second app he looks like he voluneerterd to help his team ad
Very high level Networking. Qutie a bit of prompting (Not meeting the bar)

•	Tell me about a time when you were working on something and realized your approach wasn’t likely the best approach. What was the situation and what did you do?

Nqobile was working on a student project where you was creating a Time management app. The components of the app where split into different work areas like working on the console and database elements. Because the database elements used Windows forms, Nqobile decided to use the Azure platform for this section. However, in rechecking the requirements for the app, he found that data was not supposed to persist in the database which is what would happen if he used Azure. He took a step back and decided to use lists as a method to store data temporily. This mean change the app from being an online based app (needing to connect to the Azure platform) to one that could run locally. Nqobile was able to deliver the project on time


•	Tell me about a goal that you set for yourself that took a long time to achieve. What steps did you take to achieve your goal?

The goal Nqobile was set in high school and it was to become and IT professional. He did a lot of research in the time before starting college to try and estasblish the particular sector to study towards. Since starting college, he has set yearly goals were he aims to improve his marks and this is something he has achieve so far. He has also been pushing different certifications and has so far achieved the Introduction to Python and HTML and CSS certifications since 2021. He also taken it upon himself to keep his skills sharp by enrolling and praticing on online platforms like CodeAcademy, HackerRank and LeedCode. As he finishes colleege he aims to try and engage more with industry professionals to provide a network he can use to better himself after school.

•	Tell me about a time when you worked against tight deadlines and didn't have time to consider all options before making a decision. How much time did you have? What approach did you take? What did you learn from the situation?

Nqobile was part of a 6 person team in college that was tasked to build a tutoring application that connected students with available tutors. When a student opens the application,they have to register by filling in the relevanet information. Afterwards, they login with their details, this infomation is passed to filebased for data capturing. The same information is verified for authentication. After which, the student can move to main menu where you see the tutors available. When tutor is selected, you make a schedule with tutor

The app had a 3 month time line to build but the team was done in about 2 months. Towards the deadline for submisson, a team member was peforming unti testing and picked up and issue with the schedules students could create with their totut where the scheduling information was not being captured correctly. In order to meet the deadline, Nqobile had to do some quick troubleshooting. After 2 hours of this, we found the root cause of the issue by using an troubleshooting app called LogCat. He was to then able to resolve the issue. In reflecting on what he could have done differently, he mentioned that you should have deferred to LoCat soonner




•	Tell me about a time when you saw an issue that would impact your team and took a proactive approach to solve it. What was the issue? What did you do and what was the outcome? What did you learn from this situation?

Nqobile was working with a different team on a college project to create a time management app (Clockwise). The team was split into indiduals working on different areas of the app similar to the tutoring app. 2 members of the team where working on the project management aspect of the app and ran into an issue where the data they where capturing was not being correctly displayed in the app. These 2 members then put a request out to the rest of their team for assistance. Nqobile was the one who offered to help and then work through their code. He picked out that the issue was that the 2 had not been correctly declaring variables and once this was fixed, their section of the application was working as desgined
