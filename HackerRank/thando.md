Motivation
-----------
•	Could you please tell me more about yourself? 
I have a Diplma in Info Tech majoring in System Development and I am in my final year. I have a strong foundation in IT and I have developed solutions that allgn with Business Needs. I have a certificate from LAX in AI and I currently participating in SheCodes initiative to getting women into coding


•	What are your strengths? 
I communicates well ready to ask questions for clarity. I enjoy learning and I am very curious and this pushed me to learn coding


•	What are your areas of development (or weaknesses) that you would like to work on?  
- nervous
- struggles with presentations

•	Tell me about a time when you were working on something and realized your approach wasn’t likely the best approach. What was the situation and what did you do?

In the past, Reabetswe had had a hard time approaching people for help and tooks do it yourself approach. This would sometimes lead to instances where she would struggle with her studies and she was unwillingly to ask teachers and colleague. This manifested in her earlier life a college when she was enrolled into (maths and coding) modules that she found very difficult. However, put have reservations aside and started to more meaningful approach fellow students and lecturers to get a better understanding of the modules. By doing this, Reabetswe feels she saw signicant improvement in her work and understandings and eventually ended passing both difficult modules at the end of that sememster




•	Tell me about a goal that you set for yourself that took a long time to achieve. What steps did you take to achieve your goal?

Reabetswe current goal is to pass her BSc and graduate from college. She is yet to achieve this but, as and end to this, she has also set the descrete goals of passing and improvement. This include passing or modules school assignments, projects and these small steps are being achieve each sememter. She credits the one big step she has taken is to her goals is gher increase comfort in ask for help

[ She also mentioned that she works on projects from SheCodes course but we did not come to good examples ]

•	Tell me about a time when you worked against tight deadlines and didn't have time to consider all options before making a decision. How much time did you have? What approach did you take? What did you learn from the situation?

Reabetswe had a an assigned from SheCodes. While she had been given a week to work on a submit this assignment, she was trying to balance the assignment with her normal course. The assignment also involved concecpts (HTML and CSS) that were relatively new. What result was that, while was able to complete the assignment at the last minute, she was unhappy with the quality of her work. In the future, she was working to given herself more manageable workloads to avoid comproming the quality of other case work





•	Tell me about a time when you saw an issue that would impact your team and took a proactive approach to solve it. What was the issue? What did you do and what was the outcome? What did you learn from this situation?

Most of the projects Reabetswe are team power point projects where her and her colleague have to come up with tech related topics and present them to their class. She was selected as part of a 3 - person team to work on a presentation about Machine Learning. Her 2 class mates where not really engaages and, initially, looked as if they would have Reabetswe do all the work. However to force her classmates, she formed an IC group for their team. After that, she would actively assign tasks to each class mate and follow up to ensure their followed through. When the project was eventually presentated, all the team memebers were pleased with the result. The big take away for Reabetswe was that she realised that she was more conformtable leading that she previously thought



What did you learn from this situation?
- she was comfortable taking ownership

Networking
----------------

•	What is an IP address
    - identifies a device network, allows you to recieve and send data


•	How do you check what the IP address of your computer is? Can you check it from the command prompt?
    - Settings, Network and Internet, Wifi (depending on how)
    - Cmd button ????


•	Can you tell me difference between public and private IP address?
    - public has access to internet
    - private internal communication to the LAN


•	Difference between static and dynamic IP?
    o	Can you explain what DHCP is?
    o	What command would you use to get a new IP address from DHCP?

    - No


•	Can you explain what a router is?
    o	What is the difference between a router and a switch?

    - Connects multiple networks and directs data between them


•	Do you know what a NAT is? Why would you use it? (If very good ask about PAT)
    - No



•	What tool would you use to check the IP address of certain websites? 
    - No


•	How does the computer know which DNS server to use?
    - No



•	Q. Can you please explain the difference between TCP and UDP?
    o	Can you give any real-world examples of an application that will use each, and explain why?
    o	How a TCP connection is established? (syn, ack+syn, ack)

    - TCP responsinle for communication for devices on a network
    - ensures data is deliver reliably and in order


•	Customer mentions their website is down. When going to their domain you get a connection refused error. How would you troubleshoot this issue?	
	
		Person should be asking questions → Can cover the following: ping, traceroute, mtr, ICMP, telnet, netcat, TCP, nmap / difference between ping and traceroute and ICMP deprioritization / understand the differences between ICMP and TCP	

    - disble firewall 
    - check if service is running
    - check if computer is on network
